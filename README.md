ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Leon Erbe.  
ðŸ’š My interests include blockchain, DeFi, video games, real estate, geography, and nature. Most importantly: I love to create.  
ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently building a website for my wife's online business while learning various JS frameworks, with the hope of getting into Solidity.  
ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything, really. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with basic knowledge of Node.js, jQuery, React, C#, and Go.  
ðŸ“§ leon.c.erbe@gmail.com  

Looking for work! Freelance, contract, part-time, or -preferably- full-time. Anything not currently in my skill set (see above), I am confident I'll be able to pick up very easily as I am a fast learner.
